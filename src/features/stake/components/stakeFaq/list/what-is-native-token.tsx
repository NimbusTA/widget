        {parachainToken} is {parachainName}â€™s native token. As on Ethereum, the{' '}
        {parachainName} network charges some fee to execute a transaction. When
        you perform Stake, Unstake, or Claim, you have to pay a transactional
        cost, so you should hold {parachainToken} on your {parachainName}{' '}
        balance to cover it.
