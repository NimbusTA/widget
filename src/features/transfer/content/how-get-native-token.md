title: 'How can I get GLMR from faucet?'
---

If you have zero balance of GLMR in the Moonbeam parachain, you can simply transfer your DOT tokens from Polkadot to
Moonbeam via the Transfer page or XCM message from polkadot.js. After that, you will automatically receive some GLMR
in the Moonbeam from faucet.
