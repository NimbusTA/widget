title: 'Existential deposit on Polkadot'
---

On the Polkadot network, an address is only active when it holds a minimum amount, currently set at 1 DOT.
This minimum amount is called the Existential Deposit (ED). If you are sending all (or almost all) of your funds out of
an account, which will result in the remaining balance going under the ED, the account will be reaped and any remaining
funds will be burned.
